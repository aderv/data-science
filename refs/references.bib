	abstract = {In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualizing, and exploring data.},

	abstract = {This book is suitable for an introductory course of data analytics to help students understand some main statistical learning models, such as linear regression, logistic regression, tree models and random forests, ensemble learning, sparse learning, principal component analysis, kernel methods including the support vector machine and kernel regression, etc. Data science practice is a process that should be told as a story, rather than a one-time implementation of one single model. This process is a main focus of this book, with many course materials about exploratory data analysis, residual analysis, and flowcharts to develop and validate models and data pipelines.},

In addition specialized graphs including geographic maps, the display of change over time, flow diagrams, interactive graphs, and graphs that help with the interpret statistical models are included. Focus is on the 45 most popular graph types. The guide also includes detailed instructions on how to customizing graphs, and ends with a chapter on graphing best practices. Although strongly based on the ggplot2 package, other approaches are included as well.},

@book{alexander2023,
	title = {Telling {Stories} with {Data}},
	url = {https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/},
	abstract = {The book equips students with the end-to-end skills needed to do data science. That means gathering, cleaning, preparing, and sharing data, then using statistical models to analyse data, writing about the results of those models, drawing conclusions from them, and finally, using the cloud to put a model into production, all done in a reproducible way.
	
	At the moment, there are a lot of books that teach data science, but most of them assume that you already have the data. This book fills that gap by detailing how to go about gathering datasets, cleaning and preparing them, before analysing them. There are also a lot of books that teach statistical modelling, but few of them teach how to communicate the results of the models and how they help us learn about the world. Very few data science textbooks cover ethics, and most of those that do, have a token ethics chapter. Finally, reproducibility is not often emphasised in data science books. This book is based around a straight-forward workflow conducted in an ethical and reproducible way: gather data, prepare data, analyse data, and communicate those findings. This book will achieve the goals by working through extensive case studies in terms of gathering and preparing data, and integrating ethics throughout. It is specifically designed around teaching how to write about the data and models, so aspects such as writing are explicitly covered. And finally, the use of GitHub and the open-source statistical language R are built in throughout the book.},
